# Additional Information

I work at Brock University in St.Catharines, Ontario in the Centre for Pedagogical Innovation. 

I like learning new stuff and I find the learning curve very steep for a lot of this so it's quite exciting. I'm sorry I joined so late, I didn't realize there was an open portion to this course until I saw the demo on Friday January 18.
