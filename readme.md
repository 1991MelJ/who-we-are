# Who We Are

This is the demo repository for **EXERCISE 4: forking & contributing to a repository** in module 1.

Remember - you fork this repository, then clone it to your desktop. Rename the `template.md` file with `<yourname>.md`. EG, on my machine, it becomes `drgraham.md`. Change the file accordingly to edit in your name, and the location of your online HQ & open notebook as properly formatted markdown. Then, make a pull request.
